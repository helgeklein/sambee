Sambee's dual-pane mode shows the contents of two directories next to each other. This layout was popularized by Norton Commander and later Total Commander. It makes it easier to move or copy files between directories and to compare two directories visually.

## Work in Dual-Pane Mode

To switch between single-pane and dual-pane mode:

- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> to switch from single-pane to dual-pane mode and back.

To move focus between the left and right panes:

- Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move the input focus between the left and right pane.
- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> to focus the left pane.
- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> to focus the right pane.

To copy or move files and directories:

- Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to copy the currently selected items in the active pane to the location in the inactive pane.
- Press <kbd>F6</kbd> to move instead of copying.

You can copy and move files and directories between different SMB connections, different local drives, and SMB connections and local drives. Sambee completes the destination copy before it removes the original during a move.

While a copy or move is in progress, the dialog shows its progress. Select Cancel to stop an active transfer. If a destination item already exists, use the Target already exists dialog to skip it or choose a different name.

If Sambee creates the destination for a move but can't remove the original, it reports the partial move and keeps the original in place. Review both panes before trying the move again.

## Extract Selected ZIP Members

When the active pane shows a ZIP archive, select the files or directories to extract and press <kbd>F5</kbd>. Sambee extracts the selected members into the physical location in the inactive pane. Selecting a directory extracts all of its contents, including empty directories.

Archive members can't be moved. <kbd>F6</kbd> stays unavailable in a ZIP archive pane and doesn't modify the archive.

## Requirements

- Dual-pane mode is currently a desktop-only feature (i.e., not available on mobile due to screen size limitations).
