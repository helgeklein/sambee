title = "Dependency Update Workflow"
+++

Use this page for routine dependency updates and dependency-related release preparation. Use [Product Versioning](../product-versioning/) when changing the Sambee version, and [Release Checklist](../release-checklist/) when preparing a complete product release.

## Dependency Update Rules

Routine install behavior and actual dependency changes are different workflows.

- use `npm ci` for routine installs in `frontend/` and `companion/`
- use the hashed backend lockfiles for routine Python installs
- do not hand-edit generated lockfile details when the repository already provides a regeneration workflow
- accept Dependabot updates to backend requirements and pip-compile lockfiles when CI validation passes

### Backend Dependency Updates

For routine Dependabot backend dependency-update pull requests:

- review the direct requirement and generated lockfile changes
- do not rerun the backend lockfile refresh script only to satisfy CI
- validate with backend tests and type checking

CI verifies that direct source pins match both generated lockfiles. The backend
test image and production Docker image validate hash-enforced installations.

For manual backend dependency changes or an intentional full transitive refresh:

- update `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` first
- regenerate `requirements.lock.txt` and `requirements-dev.lock.txt` through `scripts/refresh-backend-lockfiles`
- treat resolver conflicts as real compatibility constraints instead of forcing transitive pins by hand
- avoid hand-editing lockfile hashes except as a last resort

Use `scripts/refresh-backend-lockfiles --check` when you deliberately want to
compare the committed locks with a new clean dependency resolution. It is an
optional maintenance check, not a required step for routine Dependabot pull
requests.

### High-Risk Dependency Areas

Some ecosystems are intentionally treated as coordinated manual changes rather than casual bumps.

- high-risk frontend packages such as React, Vite, TypeScript, and MUI
- companion Tauri package and crate alignment
- backend packages with higher behavioral risk such as `smbprotocol` and `pyvips`

Additional contributor rules in those areas:

- keep companion Tauri JavaScript packages and Rust crates on matching major.minor versions
- validate companion Tauri alignment with `scripts/check_tauri_version_alignment.py` when those dependencies move
- review Dependabot proposals for the shared Python runtime base as container-runtime changes
- confirm Docker target validation reports the expected Python and SQLite versions before merging a Python runtime update
- expect Debian packages to refresh during cache-busted image builds; do not hand-pin individual APT packages unless reproducibility requirements change
- prefer committed scripts and lockfiles over one-off installers or floating `npx` downloads

## Dependency Security Audits

The audit workflow and Dependabot configuration now live in the Developer Guide security section.

Use [Dependency Security and Dependabot](../../security/dependency-security-and-dependabot/) for:

- Dependabot grouping and ignore rules
- scheduled dependency audit coverage

Use [Container Image Security and Artifact Integrity](../../security/container-image-security-and-artifact-integrity/) for:

- container-image vulnerability scanning
- Trivy suppression policy
- image signing, SBOM, and provenance controls

Keep this page focused on dependency inputs, generated lockfiles, and dependency-specific validation.

## Validation Expectations

At minimum, run the checks for the subsystem whose release-sensitive files changed.

Common examples:

```bash
cd backend && pytest -v
cd backend && mypy app
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint
cd companion && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint
```

Choose the relevant subset based on the dependencies that changed.
