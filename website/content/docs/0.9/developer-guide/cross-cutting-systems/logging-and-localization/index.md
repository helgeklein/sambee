title = "Logging and Localization"
+++

Logging and localization are both cross-boundary product systems in Sambee.

- Logging affects local debugging, operator visibility, and backend trace collection.
- Localization affects typed UI copy, locale behavior, browser formatting, and browser-to-companion sync.

Treat both as shared contracts rather than optional polish.

## Logging Model

Sambee uses more than one logging surface, but the goal is still one coherent diagnostic story.

### Backend Logging

The backend sends logs to standard output so they are available through Docker or the process supervisor. Configure the backend in the `[app]` section of `config.toml`:

```toml
[app]
log_level = "INFO"
access_log_level = "WARNING"
protocol_log_level = "WARNING"
```

| Key | Controls | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `log_level` | Application diagnostics and Uvicorn startup, shutdown, and error messages. | `INFO` |
| `access_log_level` | Uvicorn HTTP request access records. | `WARNING` |
| `protocol_log_level` | Uvicorn WebSocket connection, frame, and keepalive records. | `WARNING` |

All three settings accept `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR`, regardless of case. The default access and protocol levels keep successful requests, WebSocket payloads, and ping traffic out of normal operational logs while retaining application lifecycle and error messages.

Set `access_log_level` to `INFO` when request auditing is needed. Set `protocol_log_level` to `DEBUG` only while diagnosing WebSocket communication; it includes sent and received frames as well as keepalive messages and can be very verbose.

### Browser App Logging

The browser app supports both:

- Console logging for local development and debugging.
- Backend tracing for server-side log collection when production or mobile debugging needs it.

That means a logging change can affect both developer ergonomics and support visibility.

### Companion and Service-Side Logging

The companion has its own desktop-side logging path, and operational logs are still important on the backend and in local development scripts.

- Use the shared logging utilities where the app already has them.
- Keep log messages specific enough to be actionable.
- Avoid replacing structured or filtered logging with scattered ad hoc output.

For local environment diagnosis, the repo also provides supported log and service-status scripts instead of relying entirely on manual process inspection.

## Localization Model

Localization is a typed system, not just a string file.

### Sources of Truth

| Area | Source |
|---|---|
| Browser app translations | `frontend/src/i18n/resources.ts` |
| Companion translations | `companion/src/i18n/resources.ts` |
| Typed wrappers | each app's `i18n/index.ts` layer |

English is the source locale, and the pseudo-locale is generated automatically from the English tree.

### Contributor Rules

- Add new UI strings through the translation resources instead of hard-coding copy.
- Keep translation keys type-safe instead of casting around the type system.
- Preserve the distinction between UI language and regional formatting behavior.
- Remember that the browser app can push its effective locale into the companion through the paired localhost API.

## What Contributors Must Preserve

### Logging

- Browser app logging and backend tracing are related but separately configurable.
- Logging changes should not silently remove trace visibility that support workflows depend on.
- Diagnostics should stay specific and action-oriented.

### Localization

- Typed keys should remain enforced.
- Browser-localization behavior and companion-localization sync should keep using effective locale values rather than raw unresolved preferences.
- App-owned UI text should stay translatable.

For the concrete contributor workflow, continue to [Localization and Locale Behavior](../localization-and-locale-behavior/).

## Common Failure Modes

- Adding UI text without a translation key.
- Bypassing typed translation keys with casts.
- Changing localization behavior in the browser app without checking companion sync effects.
- Switching logging behavior in a way that helps local debugging but breaks backend tracing or support visibility.
- Flooding logs with noisy messages that hide the actionable ones.

## Validation Expectations

When this area changes, usually run:

```bash
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
cd frontend && npm run lint
cd companion && npx tsc --noEmit
cd companion && npm run lint
```

For higher-confidence changes, add the relevant frontend or companion tests, especially when localization sync or logging configuration behavior changes.
