title = "Local-Drive and Save-Back Pipeline"
+++

The companion supports two different desktop-side data paths.

- paired local-drive access through the localhost API
- SMB-backed native-app editing with temp files, locks, and explicit save-back

They are related because the same desktop app participates in both, but they do not share the same trust or data lifecycle.

## Local-Drive Access Pipeline

For local drives, the browser stays in control and the companion behaves like a desktop-local backend.

1. the browser detects the companion through the localhost health endpoint
2. browser and companion pair explicitly
3. the browser requests available drives
4. the browser routes local-drive browse, file, and file-management requests to the companion instead of the server backend
5. a companion-side watcher and WebSocket channel keep local directory state fresh

This is why local drives can appear inside the same UI as SMB shares while still using a different execution path.

## Localhost API Shape

The companion embeds a localhost HTTP server and mirrors the backend API contract closely enough that the frontend can stay mostly connection-type agnostic.

The server is bound to `127.0.0.1:21549` and exposes routes under `/api`.

Representative endpoints include:

- `GET /api/health`: companion availability and pairing state
- `POST /api/pair/initiate`: begin pairing
- `POST /api/pair/confirm`: finish pairing after dual confirmation
- `GET /api/drives`: enumerate available local drives and volumes
- `GET /api/browse/{drive}/list`: list a directory
- `GET /api/browse/{drive}/info`: stat one file or directory
- `GET /api/browse/{drive}/directories`: search directories recursively
- `GET /api/viewer/{drive}/file`: stream a file for inline viewing
- `GET /api/viewer/{drive}/download`: stream a file as a download
- `POST /api/browse/{drive}/upload`: upload a file into the drive-backed path
- `DELETE /api/browse/{drive}/item`: delete a file or directory
- `POST /api/browse/{drive}/rename`: rename a path
- `POST /api/browse/{drive}/create`: create a file or directory
- `POST /api/browse/{drive}/copy`: copy within or across local drives
- `POST /api/browse/{drive}/move`: move within or across local drives
- `WS /api/ws`: companion-side directory change notifications

Response shapes intentionally follow the backend contract so the browser can reuse models such as directory listings and file info instead of maintaining a separate local-drive UI protocol.

## Local-Drive Operation Rules

- the companion mirrors the backend API contract closely so the frontend can stay mostly connection-type agnostic
- local-drive operations use desktop filesystem primitives, not SMB semantics
- local files opened directly through the companion can skip download, lock, upload, and the "Done Editing" flow entirely

Additional rules that matter in practice:

- image conversion is not part of the companion local-drive path; raw local files are served directly
- local-drive browsing has no SMB edit-lock semantics
- same-drive copy and move use local filesystem operations directly
- cross-backend transfers between SMB and local storage are browser-mediated rather than hidden inside the companion's direct-open flow

That direct local-open path is intentionally different from SMB-backed native-app editing.

## Drive Enumeration Model

The companion discovers drives and mounted volumes automatically.

Platform-specific inputs differ, but the goal is the same: expose what the current desktop user can already access through the normal filesystem.

- Windows: fixed drives, removable drives, mapped drives, and virtual drives exposed through the filesystem
- macOS: mounted volumes under the normal desktop volume model
- Linux: mounted filesystems that represent real file content rather than pseudo-filesystems

That includes cloud-backed or virtual drives when they appear through the OS filesystem layer.

The browser therefore does not need manual drive configuration. It asks the companion for the current drive list and renders those entries alongside SMB connections.

The companion should still filter out pseudo-filesystems and other non-file mounts that would only add noise or unsafe paths.

## Browser Routing and Auth Behavior

The browser uses the same UI for SMB and local drives, but the request path changes underneath.

- SMB-backed requests continue through the main Sambee backend
- local-drive requests route to the companion localhost API instead
- the browser detects the companion through the health endpoint
- once paired, it requests drives and merges them into the connection list as local-drive entries

Authentication also changes:

- backend requests use the normal server-side auth model
- companion requests use the pairing-derived HMAC model described in [Browser-to-Companion Trust Model](../browser-to-companion-trust-model/)

That distinction is critical. Local-drive access is not "server auth pointed at localhost". It is a separate authenticated browser-to-desktop channel.

## Local-Drive Watching and WebSockets

The companion keeps local directory state fresh through its own watcher and WebSocket path.

- the browser opens a companion WebSocket when local-drive behavior is active
- subscriptions are tracked per directory
- the companion shares watcher state when possible instead of creating wasteful duplicate watchers
- local directory changes propagate back into the same browser refresh model used by the file browser

This is why local drives can participate in the same dual-pane and refresh workflows as SMB connections without pretending the transport is the same.

## SMB-Backed Native-App Save-Back Pipeline

For SMB-backed native-app editing, the companion is not the source of truth. It is the desktop-side coordinator for a backend-governed editing lifecycle.

1. the browser launches a `sambee://` deep link
2. the companion exchanges the URI token for an authenticated session
3. it fetches metadata and downloads the file to a temp directory
4. it acquires the backend edit lock
5. it opens the file in the chosen native application
6. a "Done Editing" window stays open while heartbeat and file-status checks continue in the background
7. on explicit user confirmation, the companion uploads the file or discards it
8. the backend lock is released and the temp file is recycled

## Why Save-Back Uses Explicit Confirmation

The save-back model uses explicit user action rather than automatic filesystem watching.

That avoids a harder class of problems around:

- partial writes and atomic-save behavior
- repeated intermediate uploads
- uncertainty about when editing is truly finished

The hold-to-confirm interaction is therefore a product decision, not just a UI quirk.

## Conflict and Recovery Behavior

The companion keeps operation state because desktop editing can outlive one clean process lifecycle.

- operation state is persisted alongside temp files for recovery
- server state is checked before overwrite-sensitive upload completes
- when server state changed during editing, the user must resolve the conflict rather than silently replacing the file

## Critical Distinction Contributors Must Preserve

- local-drive workflows do not use backend SMB edit locks
- SMB-backed native-app editing does use backend lock, heartbeat, and upload semantics
- cross-backend transfers between SMB and local storage are their own browser-mediated flow, not a shortcut through the deep-link edit lifecycle
- localhost API pairing and HMAC auth are part of the product contract, not replaceable convenience layers

If you blur these paths, you usually break either security assumptions or data-integrity guarantees.

## Where the Main Logic Lives

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `companion/src-tauri/src/server/` | localhost API, drive enumeration, auth, pairing, and watcher behavior |
| `companion/src-tauri/src/commands/open_file.rs` | download and native-app open lifecycle |
| `companion/src-tauri/src/commands/upload.rs` | upload, lock, and heartbeat support |
| `companion/src-tauri/src/sync/operations.rs` | operation state and recovery tracking |
| `frontend/src/services/backendRouter.ts` | routes browser requests to backend or companion based on connection type |

## Design Constraints and Deliberate Tradeoffs

Some local-drive behavior is intentionally scoped rather than incomplete by accident.

- local direct-open avoids the SMB save-back lifecycle on purpose
- raw local files are served directly instead of bundling server-style image conversion into the companion path
- drive scope follows what the current desktop user can already access rather than inventing a separate path-allowlist model by default
- cross-backend file movement is a separate browser-mediated path because SMB and local-drive backends do not share one native transfer primitive

## Validation Expectations

When this pipeline changes, usually run:

```bash
cd companion && npx tsc --noEmit
cd companion && npm run lint
cd companion/src-tauri && cargo test
cd frontend && npm test
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
cd backend && pytest -v
```

The backend checks matter whenever the change touches SMB-backed save-back, lock, heartbeat, or upload behavior.
