Sambee's dual-pane mode shows the contents of two directories next to each other. This layout was popularized by Norton Commander and later Total Commander. It makes it easier to move or copy files between directories and to compare two directories visually.

## Work in Dual-Pane Mode

To switch between single-pane and dual-pane mode:

- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> to switch from single-pane to dual-pane mode and back.

To move focus between the left and right panes:

- Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move the input focus between the left and right pane.
- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> to focus the left pane.
- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> to focus the right pane.

To copy or move files and directories:

- Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to copy the currently selected items in the active pane to the location in the inactive pane.
- Press <kbd>F6</kbd> to move instead of copying.

Copying or moving files between different SMB connections, different local drives, and even between SMB connections and local drives is fully supported.

## Requirements

- Dual-pane mode is currently a desktop-only feature (i.e., not available on mobile due to screen size limitations).
